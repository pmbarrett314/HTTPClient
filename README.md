Write a simple TCP client and server.   
Both the client and server will run on the same machine.  
The client sends a succinct greeting to the server and server responds.    
The server will be invoked with the command   
\>\> server serverport  
and the client with the command  
\>\> client serverIP serverport    
For the server, choose a port number between greater than 4000.   
For the client determine the IP address of the server (which is also the IP address of the client!)   
and pass the argument serverIP as a character string in the dotted IP notation. (Due Feb 11)
